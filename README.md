# OutlookMoveMail
VBA to Move Mails from one folder to another folder automatically based on timer events
This works on 64 Bit Office / Outlook Pro Plus 2016 - Not tested on other platforms. 
Timer related declarations would change for 32 bit editions.

This script should be loaded as VBA project and Outlook security settings for macros needs to be relaxed unless you are going to sign the macros digitally.
